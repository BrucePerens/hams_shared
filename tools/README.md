# HAMS Shared Tools

This directory contains various utility scripts and tools used for development, testing, linting, and infrastructure management within the `hams_open` project.

## Purpose
The scripts in this directory automate common development workflows and enforce project standards. This includes running tests (`test.py`), enforcing linter rules (`run_linters.py`), validating environments (`env_validator.py`), and managing infrastructure (`infrastructure.py`, `provision.py`).

## Usage
Tools are typically executed directly from the command line or invoked as part of a CI/CD pipeline or local development workflow. For example:
- Run tests: `python hams_shared/tools/test.py`
- Run linters: `python hams_shared/tools/run_linters.py`
- Check tracked external dependencies (ardopcf, mercury, pat, hamlib, plus `binary_manifest.json`'s entries) against their real upstream releases: `python hams_shared/tools/check_dependency_releases.py` (manifest: `dependency_watch.json`; wired into a weekly scheduled CI run, `.github/workflows/dependency-watch.yml`)
